# 0.9.8

- If using aura evaluation only in combat, when combat ended, in some instances auras would not be removed.
- More selective use of setting auras origins to parent ids where the effect has an origin uuid that points to an actors item, and it's not a transfer effect.

# 0.9.7

- Set Effect Origin to parent item for fun transfer effect times in D&D 3.0, in more instances.

- Initial Canvas parse of effects would not always trigger, so for example a Paladins Aura effect would not be applied until the Paladin moved.

# 0.9.5

- Apply Active Effect Icon will now work.
- Custom evaluation conditions now expose `auraEntity` as the entity from which the aura emanates. If the origin was a Token you can check `auraEntity.document.actor` for the originating aura actor, or `auraEntity.document` for the TokenDocument.

- ActiveAuras was not exported through the legacy window mode.

# 0.6.1
- Effects which had previously been marked as active auras and had ignore self checked, but were no longer marked as active effects would cause the effect to not be applied to the actor.

[BUGS] Currently Macro-Repeat function from TimesUp/DAE is broken with auras

## 0.2.04
[BREAKING]
Added combat check, by default tokens will only gain auras if combat is active. This is to limit the performance impact of Active Auras, and hopefully reduce stuttering and lag issues. There is a setting to remove this lock, however use at your own risk.
For anyone updating AA, please use the command ActiveAuras.RemoveAllAppliedAuras() either in a macro or the console to reset your canvas after updating, this will be required on any canvas with auras currently active

## 0.2.00
Lots of updates for templates and drawings
- Any template effect can now call a AA macro (included in the compendium) in the Midi QoL OnUse field to apply any active effects to the template rather than the targeted tokens.
    - This template will then act as its own source of an aura, any tokens that move inside the template will have the arua applied to them (not radius from the placement)
    - For setting up auras like this, simply put any non-0 value inside the aura radius and call the "AA ApplyEffectsToTemplate" macro in Midi QoL OnUse
- Auras can now be added to drawings through macros and will apply via the same logic as templates
    - Any token within a drawing will have the aura applied to them
    - Freehand drawings are not supported
    - `drawing.setFlag("ActiveAuras", "IsAura", [effect.data])` where effect is the active effect to apply
    - There is a bundled macro to select an active effect from a premade actor avaliable in the compendium, which has several "zone effect" style auras setup

- Added Korean Localization
- Fixed a localization issue

## 0.1.4
- Added option for Alignment/Type checks before application
- Added optional save before application
- More bug fixes to prevent multiple application(check for auras before running workflow on token create)
- Auras no-longer apply when a token is at 0 hp (optional toggle in the settings)

## 0.1.3
- added filter for pre-update token to prevent non-effect updates triggering the main workflow
- fixed CreateActiveEffect function that previously saved token ID to the aura map, rather than updating on a single applied token.
